# Effect_of_LR_and_optimizer_on_NN_parameters
This repository contains the code which demonstrates the effect of learning rate and optimizers on NN parameters.
Firstly we start with the question, what is the difference between an untrained NN and trained NN ? Then after answering the question 
we visualize the training process to understand the effect of learning rate and optimizers.

The core code is present in the file Basics_of_NN.ipynb and snapshots during training are there in Image folder. The filename in the 
Image folder is as follows,
<optimizer_name>_<learning_rate>_<iteration_at_which_snapshot_is_taken>.png
